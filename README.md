## Introduction

The primary purpose of this document is to define the comprehensive set of requirements for the development of a sophisticated and user-centric website tailored for a vehicle dealership. Additionally, it aims to outline the specifications and functionalities of an integrated Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that plays a pivotal role in managing customer data and optimizing dealership operations.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a state-of-the-art online platform for a vehicle dealership. This platform serves as a virtual showroom, offering a dynamic space for potential customers to explore an extensive range of vehicles. It provides detailed and up-to-date information on each vehicle, including specifications, features, and pricing. Furthermore, it facilitates the scheduling of test drives, giving customers the opportunity to interact with their preferred vehicles in person.

In parallel, the CRM system integrated into the platform extends its reach to the back-end operations of the dealership. It proficiently collects, organizes, and manages customer data, enabling the admin/owner to make data-driven decisions. This CRM system serves as a central hub for customer interactions, analytics, staff management, and business growth strategies.

### Scope

The scope of this project encompasses the conceptualization, design, development, and deployment of a state-of-the-art online platform. This platform will not only serve as a virtual showroom but also offer a dynamic space for potential customers to explore an extensive range of vehicles. It will provide detailed and up-to-date information on each vehicle, including specifications, features, and pricing. Furthermore, it will facilitate the scheduling of test drives, giving customers the opportunity to interact with their preferred vehicles in person.

In parallel, the CRM system integrated into the platform extends its reach to the back-end operations of the dealership. It will proficiently collect, organize, and manage customer data, enabling the admin/owner to make data-driven decisions. This CRM system will serve as a central hub for customer interactions, analytics, staff management, and business growth strategies.

### Inspiration

The conceptualization of this project is deeply rooted in the opulent world of luxury and exotic car showrooms. Specifically, it draws inspiration from the renowned Dubai showroom, where customers are granted an exclusive opportunity to explore and acquaint themselves with an array of vehicles before making reservations or purchases. This inspiration fuels our commitment to providing a comparable online experience that seamlessly bridges the digital and physical realms of vehicle exploration.

### Users

The system caters to two primary user roles:

- Customers: This user group represents individuals who visit the website with the intention of exploring vehicles, scheduling test drives, and potentially purchasing a vehicle. They are at the forefront of the customer-facing functionalities.

- Admin/Owner: The admin/owner holds a central position in managing dealership operations. They have exclusive access to the CRM system, granting them the authority to oversee business processes, customer data, analytics, and staff management.

### Functionality

The website provides the following key functionalities for customers:

- Vehicle Exploration: Customers can navigate through a diverse collection of vehicles, accessing comprehensive details such as specifications, features, pricing, and availability.

- Test Drive Scheduling: Customers can effortlessly schedule test drives for vehicles of interest, with the flexibility to choose between on-site inspection at the dealership or having the vehicle made available for inspection at their location.

- Informed Decision-Making: The platform empowers customers with the necessary information and tools to make informed decisions regarding potential vehicle purchases.
